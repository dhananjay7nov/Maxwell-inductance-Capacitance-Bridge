# Maxwell-inductance-Capacitance-Bridge
📌 Project Overview

The Maxwell Inductance–Capacitance Bridge is an AC bridge circuit used to accurately measure unknown inductance by comparing it with a standard capacitor and known resistances.
This project demonstrates the working, balance condition, and practical implementation of the Maxwell bridge for inductance measurement in electrical laboratories.

🎯 Objectives

1.To measure unknown inductance (L) using an AC bridge method

2.To understand the principle of impedance comparison

3.To verify bridge balance conditions

4.To gain hands-on experience with AC bridge circuits


🧠 Working Principle

1.The Maxwell bridge operates on the principle of null detection.
At balance condition:

2.No current flows through the detector

3.The ratio of impedances in one arm equals the ratio in the opposite arm

4.The unknown inductance is determined using known resistance and capacitance values, making the method accurate and reliable for medium-Q inductors.

🧩 Components Used

🔹 Unknown Inductor (Lx)

🔹 Standard Capacitor

🔹 Variable Resistors / Resistance Box

🔹 AC Power Supply

🔹 Null Detector (Headphones / Galvanometer)

🔹 Connecting Wires

🔹 Breadboard / PCB

🔧 Circuit Description

1.One arm contains the unknown inductance

2.Another arm contains a standard capacitor in series with resistance

3.Remaining arms consist of pure resistive elements

4.Bridge is balanced by adjusting resistance until detector shows null output

🧪 Procedure

1.Connect the bridge circuit as per the circuit diagram

2.Apply AC supply to the bridge
